# Recommender
Program based on dataset "imdb.csv". It recommends a film/series based on
an input at the beginning of the program and its characteristics.
For it to work, the input must be specific, so that the program can offer
film/series names that are similar to the input.
The program evaluates the following factors: name, rate, genres, violence
and type. 
At the end, the program shows the film/series recommended.
